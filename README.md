# ServerAge
A placeholder add-on used to display the age of a server, supporting both PlaceholderAPI and MVdWPlaceholderAPI. This plugin simply provides a placeholder which can display the time difference between the current and a given timestamp, meaning it can be used for different purposes too.

More information can be found on the plugin's [resource page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/serverage.63479/).
